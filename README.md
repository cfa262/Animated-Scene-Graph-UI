# Animated-Scene-Graph-UI

Guide: This application has the added abilities to animate the created animal. By changing the transformations of the animal, there is a save button in the modeling tab and an animate in the animation tab that saves the current scene graph for any animation possible. By going to the animation tab, you can hit the play button to play the animation. There is a backward and foward button to go through the animation step by step. A timeline slider is available for easy back and foward movement of the animation as well.
